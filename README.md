# WoC-Unity-Collect

## How To Use
To make the code excutable, run this command:

```bash
chomad +x myScript.sh
```

## 1/2 
Discovered that the previous approach created various projects without the desireable ".asset" files. 
To make sure the projects are Unity project, should adapt to a new apporach to first find all the Unity projects then filter out those that didn't use the graph script ".asset" files.
